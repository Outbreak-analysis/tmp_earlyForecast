temporary repo - Early forecasting models

This is a temporary repo created by David Champredon. 

R scripts to forecast future incidence very early into an outbreak. Use R packages `R0` and `EpiEstim`.

The goal is to use synthetic incidence data in order to assess the forecasting performance of various simple models.

Main scripts:
* `single_synth_forecast.R`: compare incidence forecast on a single realization of the synthetic data.
* `multi_synth_forecast.R`: compare incidence forecast on multiple realizations.
